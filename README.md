Implementations & testing of K-means, K-medoids, Divisive and Agglomerative clustering algorithms.

## K-means

This algorithm is that the points are assigned to the "averages" of the clusters, which are calculated from the average sum of the coordinates of all the points in the cluster. These centers are recalculated until the iteration takes place without changing the assignment of any point from our set of points, which means that the solution converged to the local optimum.
